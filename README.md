## Introduction

This is a project about Springforth University’s plan to set up a foodbank in the University in collaboration with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). I cleaned and analyzed the data using PowerBi desktop and provided insights and recommendation to help the University makes informed decision on the need to set up the foodbank to be sponsored by UNESCO.

For this project, I took the role of a BI analyst by analyzing the students’ responses on the survey carried out by the University on the need to set up a foodbank in the University and I offered valuable insights to convince UNESCO to sponsor the foodbank project.

## Business Problem 
Springforth University (SpU) is planning to set up a foodbank on campus in collaboration with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). However, the university needs to provide empirical reasons why the foodbank should be sponsored by UNESCO. This necessitated the university to carry out a survey among the students on food insecurity and academic performance.

## This is the dashboard Report for the Analysis 

Here is a PowerBi Dashboard report that I built to further visualize the insights derived from the survey

## Key Insights
1. Gender distribution: There were more female respondents than male respondents, particularly in the 21-30 age range.
2. Living arrangements: A majority of respondents lived off-campus, which could impact their ability to afford food due to transportation expenses.
3. Affordability of a balanced diet: The majority of respondents reported struggling to afford a balanced diet, with "Sometimes true" being selected more frequently than "Often true."
4. Skipping meals: A large proportion of students reported skipping meals, particularly final year students.
5. Financial struggles: A significant proportion of respondents reported borrowing money to support themselves and engaging in business activities to support themselves in school.
6. Hunger and academic performance: Hunger was found to negatively impact academic performance, with a majority of respondents reporting that hunger affects their attention span in class.
7. Food insecurity: A majority of respondents reported experiencing hunger and eating less in the last 12 months.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights derived from the analysis, it is greatly recommended that the institution take steps to address food insecurity among students and this could be done by setting up the already proposed campus food bank to provide students with access to nutritious food options, providing financial assistance to help cover the cost of food and transportation, and increasing awareness and education about nutrition and healthy eating habits.

The fact that a significant proportion of students reported borrowing money and engaging in business activities to support themselves in school also highlights the need for the institution to provide more financial assistance to students who are struggling to make ends meet. This could include offering more scholarships and grants, as well as providing students with access to financial planning and budgeting resources.

Overall, the survey data underscores the need for the institution to take a proactive approach to addressing food insecurity and financial struggles among students, in order to promote their health and academic success.
